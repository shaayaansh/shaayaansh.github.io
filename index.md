# About Me
Hello! I'm currently a PhD student at The Graduate Center, CUNY. My PhD degree is in computer science with a focus on natural language 
processing (NLP) advised by Dr. Sarah Ita Levitan.

Before joining a PhD program, I graduated from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering.

# Research Interests

My research is focused on natural language processing, with special emphasis on detecting opinionated and persuasive language in news. I have also worked 
on detecting propaganda and predicting how users perceive trustworthiness of different news articles.

I am passionate about machine learning and large language models (LLMs), and I work on domain adaptation techniques for NLP to create robust models for 
various tasks.
